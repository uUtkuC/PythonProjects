This is a simple game that I made. You bet on a turtle by typing its color, and then watch the turtles as they race. I had inspiration from the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpmFbWO6HPU. ( the game idea and the initial starting points like coloring the turtles and spinning them before placing them on the screen). In addition added the betting functionality and additional pop-up screens to make it more user friendly and fun.
